# Todoiz

Todo-iz is a todo list application inspired by the clear todo app. It lets you make different todo lists that show up as individual colours and when you go into that todo list and you add new items to the list it as you add new items your todo list has this awesome gradient that goes from lighter to darker. This application incorporates the use of cocoPods for the gradient feature and for the swipe to delete feature. All of this data is saved and persisted locally with no internet required via the database Realm.
